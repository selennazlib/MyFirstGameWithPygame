# My First Game with Pygame
![](https://image.prntscr.com/image/Jl8WEt57S_y7GhSGTQf7yQ.png)
This is my first game trial with pygame. Here are the libraries that I used :
 - pygame
 - random
## Features :
 - Seperately moving enemies
 - Attacking with double sword 
 - Dynamic player movement 
 - Score system
 - Near perfect pixel collision
## How to play ?
 There are several enemies that you have to attack to finish the game and score.  You have to click space button to shoot swords to enemies and to finish the game you must get your scores to 3.  
*Note that you only have control on swords.* Enemies and player moves themselves by default.
